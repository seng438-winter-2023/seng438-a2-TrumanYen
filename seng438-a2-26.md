# 1 Introduction

Text…

# 2 Detailed description of unit test strategy

// including the input partitions you have designed

# 3 Test cases developed

Text…

// write down the name of the test methods and classes. Organize the based on
the source code method // they test. identify which tests cover which partitions
you have explained in the test strategy section //above

# 4 How the team work/effort was divided and managed

The work was divided by assigning members to test different functions. Most members tested 3 functions, while there was one who tested 1. That person was tasked with formatting the report. Each member had to outline the equivalence classes, boundary values, and partions for their functions. They also had to write how they were going to approach their test, whether that be weak-normal ect, weak robust ECT etc.

# 5 Difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned

An obstacle encountered was setting up the testing environment on a local machine. Most members had several issues before they could even start testing. This was overcome by asking other members for help, and everyone was able to get it setup. Another obstacle was how to properly use Mock objects in a test case. The issue was that certain tests did not require mock objects, and it was up to the user to identify where they would be needed and how to initialize them for their purposes. The most significant lesson learnt was to better prepare for upcoming labs, as there was cerainly a time constraint for this one.

# 6 Comments/feedback on the lab itself

The lab itself showed us the essentials of black box testing, and how to plan and implement tests. Members learnt more about ect, partitions and boundary values, as well as their significance when creating tests. Group members also communicated and conducted research to create the best possible overall tests.
