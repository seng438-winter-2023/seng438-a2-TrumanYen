# 1 Introduction

In this lab we tested a variety of functions provided by the teaching team at SENG 438. Each member had a set of functions they had to test, and were responsible for setting up there testing environment. We had an opportunity to practice black box testing techniques such as boundary values and equivalence classes. Furthermore, Some major benefits of using mock objects while conducting tests is that they allow you to mimic object behaviour. This allows us to test an object without having to create complete objects. This is a huge advantage as some objects only occur in certain scenarios, so you would have to have a large portion of your program running just to test a singular function. This saves both time, memory and energy when conducting tests. However the drawbacks are that when making mocks, you are not testing a function with the real object that it would interact with otherwise. Furthermore, not all test cases require mocks, so defining them in certain situations can prove wasteful.

# 2 Detailed description of unit test strategy

To formulate test cases, we separated each of the functions under test into equivalence classes. Each test may have had unique equivalence classes. So each time a test was performed we defined the equivalence classes. Under each function you will find all of our equivalence classes, which could then be used to find partitions, as well as boundary values. Each function will also indicate the boundary values used for testing.

# 3 Test cases developed

# Functions tested for DataUtilities

### Functions tested for DataUtilities

# 4 How the team work/effort was divided and managed

The work was divided by assigning members to test different functions. Most members tested 3 functions, while there was one who tested 1. That person was tasked with formatting the report. Each member had to outline the equivalence classes, boundary values, and partions for their functions. They also had to write how they were going to approach their test, whether that be weak-normal ect, weak robust ECT etc.

# 5 Difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned

An obstacle encountered was setting up the testing environment on a local machine. Most members had several issues before they could even start testing. This was overcome by asking other members for help, and everyone was able to get it setup. Another obstacle was how to properly use Mock objects in a test case. The issue was that certain tests did not require mock objects, and it was up to the user to identify where they would be needed and how to initialize them for their purposes. The most significant lesson learnt was to better prepare for upcoming labs, as there was cerainly a time constraint for this one.

# 6 Comments/feedback on the lab itself

The lab itself showed us the essentials of black box testing, and how to plan and implement tests. Members learnt more about ect, partitions and boundary values, as well as their significance when creating tests. Group members also communicated and conducted research to create the best possible overall tests.
